## About The Project


This project solves the 8 puzzle game in the optimal number of moves using A* hueristic search!


The user has the ability to enter a puzzle and select from different hueristic algorithms to solve it. There are 3 available algorithms: 
```
Uniform Cost Search
A* Search with Misplaced Tile Hueristic
A* Search with Euclidean Distance Hueristic
```

The idea behind an 8 puzzle game is to unscramble any given board into the goal state:


To enter a


## Design


To solve a user entered 8 puzzle, I utilized object oriented design to create a `state` class with 4 operators which manipulates the board!
